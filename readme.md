    - # Important Modification
        - There is a issue found in `@discord/voice` <a href="https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/issues/9185">VoiceConnection stuck in signalling state about a minute after creating it.</a>
        - A temporary fix for this is opening the file in `node_modules/@discordjs/voice/dist/index.js` and addding `this.configureNetworking();` in line 1361.
